# seizure-cycle-sims
Assorted simulations on seizure cycles.

`FilterDiscreteSpikes.ipynb` contains a simple simulation of a random time series.  Discrete spikes are generated and then filtered using an averaging filter.  The Fast Fourier Transform is taken to see if the expected frequency peaks are present.
